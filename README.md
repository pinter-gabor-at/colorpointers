# Color Pointers (Fabric)

![Screenshot](./images/screenshot.png "Arrow Pointers screenshot")

**Allows you to place arrows on any full block to aid you on your mining journeys. Never lose your way again.**

Hitting the corner of a block places an arrow pointing in that direction, hitting the center creates an X, but consumes 2 arrows.  
The placed arrows emit a faint light, and they are visible even in the dark.  
Spectral arrows work similarily, but the placed arrows are brighter, perfect for caving action!

## For developers

Quite often, when I start learning programming on a new platform, I find even the simplest examples too complicated.
Tutorials, written by experts, with years of experience programming on that platform, sometimes forget how difficult those first step are.  
This is why I decided to make my first Minecraft mods publicly available.
